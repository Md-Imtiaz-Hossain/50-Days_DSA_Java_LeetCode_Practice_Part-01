📢 Day 16: Embarking on a 50-Day DSA Challenge!

Check! 🎯 I’m tackling a personal challenge to share daily learnings for the next 50 days, no skips allowed! And to kick things off, I'm diving into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) – something I've been eager to master.

📌 Today's conquest: Given an unsorted array of integers nums, find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. 🧩🔍

Feeling: Motivated and energized! ⚡ Already looking forward to the Day 17th adventure.

Let's learn together! Share your own DSA journey in the comments below.
